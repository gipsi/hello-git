Hello git!

I'm going to get to know more about you.

I'm going to visit every day.

03.12.2016 I finished the git-it challenges.  Had a go with forks clones and branches and collaborated with a robot!
@reprorobot ~ meow!.  Pushed and pulled stuff from posh~git, which worked despite a bright yellow "WARNING" that told me
"Powershell 2.0 is deprecated; you have version 2.0". ... Two options ... download version 3.0 or supress the warning.  I took the third option and just left the warning at the top of the shell.

   3.git status
   4.git add readme.txt
   6.git commit -m updated readme.txt

   again again! ... again

Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting

with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

On branch master

Changes to be committed:

new file: HelloCodeSchoolProject

new file: gipsi.github.io

new file: hello-git

modified: readme.txt

Changes not staged for commit:

modified: hello-git (new commits, modified content)

Part of my problem stemmed I think from changing this readme file from .txt to .md and then deleting the .txt from the remote repository. There was a conflict "further up the working tree" which I spent some time trying to fix (an hour++) eventually reinstating the file seemed the easier option. Lesson learned: be careful what you commit.
