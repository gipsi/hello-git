Hello git!

I'm going to get to know more about you.

I'm going to visit every day.

03.12.2016 I finished the git-it challenges.  Had a go with forks clones and branches and collaborated with a robot!
@reprorobot ~ meow!.  Pushed and pulled stuff from posh~git, which worked despite a bright yellow "WARNING" that told me
"Powershell 2.0 is deprecated; you have version 2.0". ... Two options ... download version 3.0 or supress the warning.  I took the third option and just left the warning at the top of the shell.

04.12.2016 Started Chrome Dev Tools Course, an Edx Thinking Mathematics course and some more git
   1.add a line to readme.txt and save file again
   2.in posh~git: git diff
   3.git status
   4.git add readme.txt
   6.git commit -m updated readme.txt

   again again! ... again
