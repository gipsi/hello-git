Hello git!

01.12.2016 I'm going to get to know more about you.

02.12.2016 I'm going to visit every day.

03.12.2016 I finished the git-it challenges.  Had a go with forks clones and branches and collaborated with a robot!
@reprorobot ~ meow!.  Pushed and pulled stuff from posh~git, which worked despite a bright yellow "WARNING" that told me 
"Powershell 2.0 is deprecated; you have version 2.0". ... Two options ... download version 3.0 or supress the warning.  I took the third option and just left the warning at the top of the shell.
