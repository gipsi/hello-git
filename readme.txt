Hello git!

2016-12-01  I'm going to get to know more about you.

2016-12-02  I'm going to visit every day.

2016-12-03 I finished the git-it challenges.  Had a go with forks clones and branches and collaborated with a robot!
@reprorobot ~ meow!.  Pushed and pulled stuff from posh~git, which worked despite a bright yellow "WARNING" that told me
"Powershell 2.0 is deprecated; you have version 2.0". ... Two options ... download version 3.0 or supress the warning.  I took the third option and just left the warning at the top of the shell.

2016-12-17 Got rather lost with posh-git terminal. git bash, git-it-electron. Consulted Stack Overflow and used git mergetool and git gui. ... and thank you Git

! (For giving me this helpful notepad text message)

Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting

with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

On branch master

Changes to be committed:

new file: HelloCodeSchoolProject

new file: gipsi.github.io

new file: hello-git

modified: readme.txt

Changes not staged for commit:

modified: hello-git (new commits, modified content)

Part of my problem stemmed I think from changing this readme file from .txt to .md and then deleting the .txt from the remote repository. There was a conflict "further up the working tree" which I spent some time trying to fix (an hour++) eventually reinstating the file seemed the easier option. Lesson learned: be careful what you commit.

2016-12-18 Decided to change the way I write dates with the help of this article: http://www.thetechnicalgeekery.com/2013/06/yyyy-mm-dd-the-best-way-to-write-dates/

Doing more exercises in the Git Shell ... still not happening with commiting from there, but I am learning to navigate better after some practice with Appendix A: Command Line Crash Course (part of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw) https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html
